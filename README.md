# Case Chronicles 
An interactive web application designed to help users log, track, 
and visualize individual cases or events, whether it's reports, incident tracking, issues, or investigative tasks. 
Built with a focus on clarity and user-centric design, the app is especially useful for individuals who need 
to present and manage their case history to a caseworker, advisor, or handler in a structured and organized way.

## What It Does
Case Chronicles lets users:

📝 Log and categorize cases with detailed notes, timestamps, and custom tags

📅 Track the timeline of events to build a clear overview

📂 Easily filter, search, and sort through multiple entries



## How It Works
Users log new cases through a clean and intuitive interface.

The app stores data in a structured format using a backend (Node.js/Express + database).

A dashboard provides real-time filtering, search, and statistical views.

Responsive frontend built with [React/Vite].

Bonus: Built with modern tooling, clean code, and scalable design patterns to allow for 
future integrations.



## Why I Built This
As a full-stack developer passionate about solving real problems and crafting meaningful user experiences, I created Case Chronicles to:

🧠 Demonstrate my ability to design and build complete web solutions — from concept to deployment

🔍 Showcase real-world use of API integration, filtering logic, and data visualization

🛠 Empower users to spot trends, resolve issues faster, and make smarter decisions through thoughtful software

🤝 Support a friend who needed a simple but powerful tool to keep track of case events
